### The Goal is to Learn new stuff and with that create full application with all features.
## Features:
- [] Library Module - with option to add new libraries for example: game/book/movie.
- [] Auth with register, login, logout - based on JWT.
- [] Account Module - with option to change password, delete account.
## Features:
- [] Create front-end with React, Redux, Typescript. 
- [] Create backend with Node.js, Express, Typescript.
- [] Add database with MongoDB.
- [] Add authentication with JWT.
- [] Add tests with Jest.

## Description:
To complete the project I will use known frontend technics. 
Besides that I will expand on my backend knowledge to write a Node server.
I will use MongoDB to store data and JWT to authenticate users, so I need to learn it.
I will also write tests to make sure that everything works as expected. That's also not known to me.
